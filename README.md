## Program Information

The attached program displays the name of the user and returns a number squared by itself. It does this by taking in the input of a user, as well as a number. After confirming the input is a number, it is squared by itself and the program outputs "Hello user! The square of x is y."

For example, by inputting "John" and "5", the program would output "Hello John! The square of 5.0 is 25.0."
